# Laptop-Request-Catalog-Item
Problem Statement:
Employees in the organization need a quick and efficient way to request laptops for work. The current process is manual and prone to delays, with no dynamic form behavior to guide users or ensure accurate data collection. To address this, a Service Catalog item needs to be created, allowing users to easily request a laptop, with dynamic fields, clear instructions, and additional functionality like resetting the form if needed. The solution should also ensure all changes are tracked for governance and deployment.

Conclusion :
 The Laptop Request Catalog Item project successfully streamlines the process of requesting laptops within the organization by leveraging ServiceNow's Service Catalog capabilities. Through the implementation of a dynamic catalog item, the project ensures that users have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, reducing errors and improving efficiency.This project demonstrates how ServiceNow can be used to replace manual, error-prone processes with automated, efficient, and user-centric solutions. It not only improves service delivery but also enhances employee satisfaction by providing a modern and streamlined request experience.
